The Number Guessing Game is a simple console-based application that generates a random number within a specified range (e.g., 1 to 100).                                                                                                                              
The player has to guess the number.                                                                                                                                                    
After each guess, the game provides feedback, telling the player if the guessed number is too high, too low, or correct.
